Deep Learning models for Brain Computer Interfaces
=================================================

This repository contains models that can be used to decode EEG and EEG signals
for brain computer interfaces (BCIs). Some of the models depend on the
functionality that is provided by ``gumpy``, a python toolbox which contains
several signal and feature processing routines that are commonly used for BCIs.
